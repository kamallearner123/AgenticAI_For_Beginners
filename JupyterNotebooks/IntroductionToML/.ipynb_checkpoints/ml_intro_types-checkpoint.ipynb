    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** is about teaching computers to learn patterns from **data** so they can make **predictions** or **decisions** without being explicitly programmed step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional programming:** You write rules → Computer + Input → **Output**  \n",
    "**Machine learning:** You provide examples (data) + correct answers → Computer **learns rules** → Can predict answers for new inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Analogy:** Instead of telling a kid *exact rules* for what counts as a fruit, you show them lots of fruit and not-fruit. Over time, they learn the **patterns** (shape, color, seeds) and recognize new fruits themselves.\n"

    "\n",
    "**Idea:** The model sees example **inputs** and their **labels** (correct answers), learns the mapping, and predicts labels for new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classification**: Predict **categories** (e.g., spam vs not spam, disease vs no disease).  \n",
    "- **Regression**: Predict **numbers** (e.g., house price, temperature tomorrow).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everyday Examples\n",
    "- **Email Spam Filter (Classification)**: Input = email text; Label = spam/not-spam.  \n",
    "- **Price Estimation (Regression)**: Input = house size, location; Label = price.\n",

    "**Idea:** No labels! The model discovers **structure** in data — groups, patterns, or lower-dimensional representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common tasks:\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Group similar items (e.g., customer segments).\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Compress features while keeping important structure (e.g., visualize high-dim data in 2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Everyday Examples\n",
    "- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers by buying behavior to tailor offers.\n",
